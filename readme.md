# Scope
A Python commandline interface tool for opening, editing, and saving changes to JSON files.

# Design
- User can open JSON files in the input folder as python dictionaries.
- Input folder for storing source JSON files that are never written to, to avoid destruction of source files.
- Output folder for saving JSON files that we create through our edits.
- Go and Back commands allow the user to move in and out of nested levels within the JSON

# Todo
- Add feature needs to be expanded to be able to add dictionaries, integers, etc in addition to strings
- New ability to extract a level and all its children into its own dictionary that can be managed and saved on its own
